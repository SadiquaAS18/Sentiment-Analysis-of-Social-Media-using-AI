# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Social-Media-using-AI

Sentiment analysis of social media content has become increasingly significant in
understanding public opinion and behaviour. This study employs a combination of advanced
machine learning algorithms—specifically, Random Forest and a hybrid model integrating
Decision Trees (DT) with Logistic Regression—to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of
Sentiment classification. The Random Forest algorithm, known for its robustness and ability to
handle large datasets, is used to capture complex patterns and interactions within the social
media text data. Meanwhile, the hybrid DT + Logistic Regression approach leverages the
strengths of both methods: Decision Trees for their interpretability and ability to model 
nonlinear relationships, and Logistic Regression for its efficiency in binary classification tasks.
The integration of these algorithms allows for a more comprehensive analysis by combining
the strengths of ensemble methods with logistic modelling. This methodological synergy not
only advances the state of Sentiment analysis but also provides a scalable and adaptable
framework for real-time social media monitoring and analysis. Furthermore, the study
evaluates the performance of the proposed models against traditional techniques,
demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency. This
research contributes to the ongoing efforts to refine Sentiment analysis tools and offers
valuable insights for applications in market research, public relations, and beyond.
